Qwikflik is an ongoing single page React.js project utilizing The Movie Database(TMDB) API. Styled components have been used to keep CSS styling seperate from the meat of the functional React components. 

-The landing page provides you a banner image of the most popular movie (based on votes and pulled from TMDB API), its description, then all subsequent movies in decending vote order.
